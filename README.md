## 1. Overview of Project:

### Fig. 2 Filtering for Dates. 

Type in "1/4/2010" in the "Enter Date" box will yield all the findings for that date. Make sure to follow the suggested placeholder elements precisely to avoid failed search.

## 3. Summary:

Since the program can only understand rigid structures,  incorrect data input will lead to a false search.  
Recommendation 1: 
Design a drop-down menu, so the user can select items from the list to minimize incorrect input.
Recommendation 2:
Design a less rigid input structure to understand names from both uppercase and lowercase spelling.
